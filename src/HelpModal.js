        I'm thinking of a countryâ€¦ enter any country name in the guess box and
        press enter to submit your guess.
      </p>

      <p>
        Guesses appear in alphabetical order, and the guess box will shift
        around based on where the correct answer fits in alphabetically.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep guessing until you get the right answer, or give up if you've lost
        all hope.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> the database of country names is sourced from all
        countries that have flag emojis.
